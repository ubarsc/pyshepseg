"""
Routines in support of tiled segmentation of very large rasters. 

Main entry routine is doTiledShepherdSegmentation(). See that
function for further details. 

The broad idea is that the Shepherd segmentation algorithm, as
implemented in the shepseg module, runs entirely in memory. 
For larger raster files, it is more efficient to divide the raster 
into tiles, segment each tile individually, and stitch the
results together to create a segmentation of the whole raster. 

The main caveats arise from the fact that the initial clustering
is performed on a uniform subsample of the whole image, in 
order to give consistent segment boundaries at tile intersections. 
This means that for a larger raster, with a greater range of 
spectra, one may wish to increase the number of clusters in order 
to allow sufficient initial segments to characterize the variation. 

Related to this, one may also consider reducing the percentile
used for automatic estimation of maxSpectralDiff (see 
:func:`pyshepseg.shepseg.doShepherdSegmentation` and
:func:`pyshepseg.shepseg.autoMaxSpectralDiff` for further details).

Because of these caveats, one should be very cautious about 
segmenting something like a continental-scale image. There is a 
lot of spectral variation across an area like a whole continent, 
and it may be unwise to use all the same parameters for the
whole area.

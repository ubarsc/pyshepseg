Python implementation of image segmentation algorithm of 
Shepherd et al (2019). Operational Large-Scale Segmentation of Imagery 
Based on Iterative Elimination. [Remote Sensing 11(6)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/6/658).

This package is a tool for Python programmers to implement the segmentation 
algorithm. It is not a stand-alone solution for people with no Python
experience. 

We thank the authors of the paper for their algorithm. This implementation 
was created independently of them, and they are in no way to blame for 
any mistakes we have made.
